This repository contains Komi Zyrian materials which are available either in Public Domain or CC-BY. The idea is to collect annotated sentences which either are completely tagged automatically or have been manually verified. Currently the work is very preliminary and not at stage where manual checking would had started. The format currently in use is [CoNLL-U](http://universaldependencies.org/format.html).

The work is conducted since April 2017 by Niko Partanen in [LATTICE](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/) laboratory in Paris.
